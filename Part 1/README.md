# ESE5190_LAB2B_PART1-10

In Part 1 we have been asked  to control the blinking of the LED using the boot button on RP2040 QtPy board. In order to do that we made a few changes in the code which can be seen by viewing our attached code file. There is also a header file Neopixel.h that needs to be a part of the folder in which you have saved your code for the successful implementation of your code. The neopixel is at pin 12, its power pin is at 11 and the boot button is at pin 21. On pressing the boot button it toggles the neopixel. The neopixel can be set to any color from RGB by defining its hex value.
