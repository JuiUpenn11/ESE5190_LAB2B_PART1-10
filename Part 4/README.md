# ESE5190_LAB2B_PART1-10

In part 3 and part 4, we have built a sequencer that has the ability to carry out the following tasks.

1)It is able to record the sequence that is recorded in the form of boot button presses.

2)It is able to replay the recorded sequence.

3)It is able to loop the sequence.

6)It is able to provide a range of functionalities such as color of neopixel and speed at which the sequence should be played. 

We have attached the file called MainCode which uses all the other C files and header files for the successful implementation of the sequencer. We have attached gifs for every action being carried out by the sequencer. Kindly view them in order to get a brief idea of the tasks being carried out by the sequencer.
